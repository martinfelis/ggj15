It's dark and a little bit scary outside of your prison cell, but you escaped with the help of your inmate and a file you found in a cake. What do you do now? There are still more steps to do to become free. Supidly you are still chained together. And the file is left in your cell. 

- Player 1: Arrow Keys 
- Player 2: W A S D 
- Player 3: I J K L 
- Your goal: escape
- Note: the first few levels are only tutorials
