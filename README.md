# Prison Broke

A little game made during the Global Game Jam 2015 (wohooo!)

http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/prison-broke

It's dark and a little bit scary outside of your prison cell, but you escaped with the help of your inmate and a file you found in a cake. What do you do now? There are still more steps to do to become free. Supidly you are still chained together. And the file is left in your cell. 

- Player 1: Arrow Keys 
- Player 2: W A S D 
- Player 3: I J K L 
- Your goal: escape
- First blue levels are tutorials

In der Dunkelheit hast du dich mit deinem Zellengenossen aus dem Fenster abgeseilt. Doch was nun? Es fehlen noch einige Schritte in die Freiheit. Bl√∂derweise seid ihr jedoch aneinander gekettet. 

- Player1: Pfeiltasten 
- Player2: W A S D 
- Ziel: Entkommen 
- Die ersten Level sind zum Kennenlernen
